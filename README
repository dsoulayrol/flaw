This is Flaw, an OO framework to handle Awesome widgets.

Flaw stands for Fully Loaded AWesome. It is an object oriented
framework which aims at helping creating widgets for Awesome
wiboxes.

- Flaw provides gadgets, which are a layer above Awesome widgets. A
  gadget is a widget augmented with properties, and a provider.

- Providers are a solution to minimize the widgets updates needs. A
provider can be used by multiple widgets. A provider maintains status
data from the system and refreshes only when necessary.

Example:

require('flaw')

...

-- Create battery monitor
local w_battery_icon = flaw.battery.icon_gadget_new('BAT0').widget
local w_battery_widget = flaw.battery.text_gadget_new('BAT0').widget

-- Create network monitor
local w_network_widget = flaw.network.text_gadget_new('wlan0').widget

    conf.screens[s].wibox.widgets = {
       ...,
       w_battery_icon,
       w_battery_widget,
       w_network_widget,
       ...
    }
