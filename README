This is Flaw, a packaged OO framework to handle Awesome widgets.

Flaw stands for Fully Loaded AWesome. It is an object oriented
framework which aims at helping creating widgets for Awesome
wiboxes.

- Flaw provides gadgets, which are a layer above Awesome widgets. A
  gadget is a widget augmented with properties, and a provider.

- Providers are a solution to minimize the widgets updates needs. A
provider can be used by multiple widgets. A provider maintains status
data from the system and refreshes only when necessary.
